\title{TRNG C++ library functionality exposed to R.}
\description{
Tina's Random Number Generator Library (\pkg{TRNG}) is a state-of-the-art C++
pseudo-random number generator library for sequential and parallel Monte
Carlo simulations (\url{https://numbercrunch.de/trng/}). It provides a variety
of random number engines (pseudo-random number generators) and distributions.
In particular, \emph{parallel} random number engines provided by TRNG support
techniques such as \emph{block-splitting} and \emph{leapfrogging} suitable
for parallel algorithms. See \sQuote{References} for an introduction to the
concepts and details around (parallel) random number generation.

Package \pkg{rTRNG} provides the \R users with access to the functionality of
the underlying TRNG C++ library in different ways and at different levels.
\itemize{
  \item
    Base-\R \link{Random}-like usage via \link{TRNG.Random} functions, for
    selecting and manipulating the current engine. This is the simplest and
    more immediate way for \R users to use \pkg{rTRNG}.
  \item
    \link[=TRNG.Engine]{Reference Objects} wrapping the underlying C++ TRNG
    random number engines can be created and manipulated in OOP-style. This
    allows greater flexibility in using TRNG engines in \R.
  \item
    TRNG C++ library and headers are made available to other \R projects
    and packages using C++.
    \itemize{
    \item
      Standalone C++ code sourced via \code{\link[Rcpp]{sourceCpp}} can rely
      on the \code{\link[=dependsAttribute]{Rcpp::depends}} attribute to
      correctly setup building against \pkg{rTRNG}.
      \preformatted{// [[Rcpp::depends(rTRNG)]]}
    \item
      Creating an \R package with C++ code using the TRNG library is achieved
      by \code{LinkingTo: rTRNG} in the DESCRIPTION file and by setting the
      relevant linker flags in Makevars[.win] via
      \code{\link[rTRNG]{LdFlags}}.
    }
}
See the package vignettes (\code{browseVignettes("rTRNG")}) for an overview
and demos and refer to the examples in the documentation for further use
cases.
